Docker info:

Docker Images vs. Containers. IMAGE :- An image is an inert, immutable, file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run. Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com.

Dockerfiles: scripts to build containers, step-by-step, layer-by-layer, automatically from a source (base) image.
