Let's start!

1. Line Spacing
1. Double-space a file.

awk '1; { print "" }'
So how does it work? A one-liner is an Awk program and every Awk program consists of a sequence of pattern-action statements "pattern { action statements }". In this case there are two statements "1" and "{ print "" }". In a pattern-action statement either the pattern or the action may be missing. If the pattern is missing, the action is applied to every single line of input. A missing action is equivalent to '{ print }'. Thus, this one-liner translates to:

awk '1 { print } { print "" }'
An action is applied only if the pattern matches, i.e., pattern is true. Since '1' is always true, this one-liner translates further into two print statements:

awk '{ print } { print "" }'
Every print statement in Awk is silently followed by an ORS - Output Record Separator variable, which is a newline by default. The first print statement with no arguments is equivalent to "print $0", where $0 is a variable holding the entire line. The second print statement prints nothing, but knowing that each print statement is followed by ORS, it actually prints a newline. So there we have it, each line gets double-spaced.
